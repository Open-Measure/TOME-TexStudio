ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same account. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document format. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs.  \end{DIC_BlockQuote} (AWS, 11/2020, p. 353)\\ (Online: \url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html})  \paragraph{} (  (link) \href{AWS, 11/2020 }{ } , p. 353)  \\  (Online:  \href{None }{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_groups.html } )  \subsection*{Bibliography } \begin{enumerate} \item  (link) \href{AWS, 11/2020 }{ }   \end{enumerate} \subsection*{See Also }
