The parent receives a copy of the child's exit code (or an indication ofwhy the child was killed if the child did not exit voluntarily) and can also obtain asummary of the child's use of resources if it wishes.This scheme works fine if parents outlive their children and are conscientiousabout calling wait so that dead processes can be disposed of. If the parent diesfirst, however, the kernel recognizes that no wait will be forthcoming and adjuststhe process to make the orphan a child of init. init politely accepts these orphanedprocesses and performs the wait needed to get rid of them when they die.  \end{DIC_BlockQuote} (Nemeth et al., 2011, p. 124)  \paragraph{} (  (link) \href{Nemeth et al., 2011 }{ } , p. 124)  \subsection*{Bibliography } \begin{enumerate} \item  (link) \href{Nemeth et al., 2011 }{ }   \end{enumerate} \subsection*{See Also }
